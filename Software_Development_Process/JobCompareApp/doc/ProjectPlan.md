# Project Plan

**Author**: _Team 173_

**Version**: _D3_

## 1 Introduction

A single system, single user Android mobile app to compare a user's current job, if available, or a specific job offer with other job offers based on a calculated job score and job-specific details. 

## 2 Process Description

1. Creating an individual UML design and description:

    1. The goal of this task is for each team member to create UML design based on the requirements listed for the job comparison application. The design must implement the four major functions of the application: add current job, add job offer, adjust comparison settings, and compare job offers. Each design will reflect each team members strategy and approach to designing an application and implementing from the requirments document.

    2. The initial inputs would be a requirements document, an enviornment to create and design a UML diagram, and knowledge about creating a UML diagram and description.

    3. The expected outputs would be a completed UML diagram and accompanying design desciption to describe how requirments are fullfilled.

2. Discussing individual designs:

    1. The goal of this task is to share each team members UML design and description to provide feedback on positive and negative qualties of the design. This practice will allow team members to understand the critical components present or missing in their designs as well as provide initial ideas about how a team UML design would be created.

    2. For inputs, team member UML diagrams and design documents.

    3. For outputs, summary/list of the pros and cons for each team members design and a design discussion document capturing information of each individual design and team design.

3. Creating a team design and description:

    1. Once each team members' design has been discussed during a meeting, the team creates a unified design based on the information gathered from the individual designs and notes about how the job comparison app should be created based on its requirements. The team design will include the major functions of the application as well as all associated classes, attributes, and operations. The unified team design offers the opportunity to include features that were not discussed or added to the individual designs or the team agrees to be important for the application. Conversely, the design should remove any unecessary features or elements in the UML design based on the team discussion.

    2. Entrance criteria would include each team members' design and discription, notes from the individual design critique, program to create UML diagram, and the app requirments.

    3. Exit criteria would include a team design and descrption, insight about how the applicaiton will be structured and implemented, and better undestanding about how to organize and application in a team context.

4. Generating critical documents for job comparison application:

    1. In addition to a team design and team description, the project team will design and create several critical documents to provide information about the project plan, use-case models, and test plan. These documents will be updated and improved at each phase and cycle of the app and provide a foundation for the software development process.

    2. Inputs include templates for each document, background knowledge regarding how each document functions, design requirments, and team discussion.

    3. Outputs include a project plan, design document, use-case model document, and test case plan.

5. Delegating tasks and organizing team roles:

    1. The goal of this step is to breakdown each task required for creating an initial version of the job comparison application into managable units or tasks. In turn, these tasks will be devided evenly, with consideration of workload and difficulty, to each team member in order to implement their portion of the application. This will provide an opportunity for team members to communicate and discuss the initial plan for creating the app and allow each part to be indepenently created without code collision or redundant work.

    2. Inputs for this step would include a team meeting to review the design, app requirments, and knowledge about each component of the application.

    3. Output would be a plan specific for each team member about how to create their component of the initial version of the app and plan to integrate all components. 

6. Implemening App Front-End UI/UX:

    1. The goal of this task is to create a specific layout for the main menu and layouts for each of the apps pages, corresponding the the user interface. The layouts will follow the draft design and will iterated over with changes as each interface is implemented. Additional, design elements may be included to provide better user experience and improve visual fidelity. The order for this step may change depending on the timeline of the application development. However, having the GUI as a basis for the rest of the app will help design the underlying functionality and remove redundant features. 

    2. The initial inputs would be a draft design, examples and mock images for a design, and a collaborative UI/UX development environment.

    3. Expected outputs would be completed designs for main menu, pages for each of the applications major functions/widgets, and data visualization elements such as tables, forms, etc.

7. Implementing Back-End:

    1. The implementation of the back-end will see the processing of the users data and data manipulation based on the system and UI classes. This step will see the underlying functionality implemented alongside the front-end GUI. Additionally, the back-end will handle the installation and storage of the information as necessary. The order of the back-end implementation may change depending on the project timeline. 

    2. Entrance criteria will include the system design plan, class specifications, design document, and collaborative programming environment.

    3. Exit criteria may include packages and features that are associated with the application

8. Integrating the all system components:

    1. This step realises the integration of front-end and back-end design into a singular system. The process will involve several steps to merge the GUI and functionality to create application components. Once, all components are assembled, they will be connected together in a logical manner to ensure that each element works seemlesly when the app is running. This step will likely occur in the middle to late stages of the application development, once the major elements of the app have been developed and require assemly.

    2. The inputs include the front-end and back-end components, system design, integration plan, collaborative enviroment, and any other necessary developer tools for system design.

    3. The output would be a complete singular application with all operations implemented from the design requirments.

9. Updating design documents:

    1. This task is intended to iterate and update the project plan, design document, use-case model, and test plan as necessary based on any and all changes that are associated with the creating of the initial version of the app. This task allows the team to discuss how the initial plan has been modified in the process and how to plan for the upcoming steps and deliverables. 

    2. The entrance criteria include an initial version of the app, earlier versions of the project documents, and team meeting to discuss.

    3. The exit criteria would include update versions of the project documents and plan for the next cycles of development.

10. Unit testing application features:

    1. This steps is the first phase of testing in which tests are developed and conducted for each application feature. The intention is to devlop feature-sepcific unit tests that will isolate the functionality of the application elements and ensure that they are reslient and provide the correct output for the user. These tests will also indicate if any other areas of the app fail that are not part of the original test. 

    2. The entrance criteria include a test plan, unit test examples, quality assurance test strategy, requirements documents, and app debugging environement.

    3. The exit criteria include functioning application features and menus, correct ouput for results, and data that ensures correct apllication function. 

11. Testing entire application:

    1. This is the second and final phase of testing. While not specific, the testing will look at the application as a whole. It can assist with determining if components need to be added, removed, or modified. If the overall application function full fills the criteria states in the project requirments and plan. This will provide an additional step to check all facets of the application.

    2. The inputs include the application, requirments, design plan, implementation history, unit tests, and development/testing environment.

    3. The output should be the completed application and any progress reports necessary.

12. Finalizing application:

    1. This is the final steps of the app which includes creating a final version of the app, creating an APK to accompany the app, finalizing testing, and analyzing the results of testing.

    2. The entrance criteria would include the latest version of the app, initial test files from unit and systems testing, any associated documents including the test plan, meeting to disucss final steps prior to app submission, collaborative work environment, and development/testing enviroment. 
    
    3. The exit criteria is a fully functionaing app that contains all of the features requested in the design requirments, an APK file based on the final version of the app, completed testing files, and results from the final tests.

13. Finalizing application and documents:

    1. This corresponds the the final phase of the app where the team wraps up the project by creating a final version of the app and accompanying documents. This step will happen after the major testing phases to ensure that the entire app runs cleanly and without fail and any bugs or missing features do not exist in the final version of the application.

    2. The inputs include results from the test case, newest version of the application, test cases, project documents, and team meeting.

    3. The outputs include a finalized version of the application and project documents.

14. Application Submission/Release:

    1. This is one of the final steps for the inital job application release. In comparable application release settings, this would mean release to the public, stakeholders, and/or companies that would like to use the application. In the context of this project, it would mean submitting the final application and all associated files for evaluation.

    2. The inputs include a final version of the app, all testing features, APK file of the final app, and all associated documents.

    3. The outputs include evaluation report, rating/grade for the project, and feedback that could assist with developing later versions of the application.
