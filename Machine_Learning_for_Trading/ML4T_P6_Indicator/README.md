# Project 6: Theoretically Optimal Strategy and Technical Indicators

## Overview
This project evaluates the performance of a **Theoretically Optimal Strategy (TOS)** and explores the use of five **technical indicators** for predicting stock price movements. The TOS significantly outperforms a benchmark strategy, achieving 6.7 times higher profit. The technical indicators are designed to generate buy and sell signals, helping to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market.

### Key Objectives
1. Implement a Theoretically Optimal Strategy (TOS) to maximize profit.
2. Develop and analyze five technical indicators:
   - **Price/SMA Ratio (P/SMA)**
   - **Price Rate of Change (ROC)**
   - **Golden/Death Cross (GDC)**
   - **Bollinger Bands (BB)**
   - **Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO)**
3. Compare the performance of TOS with a buy-and-hold benchmark strategy.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of technical indicators for predicting stock trends.
