# Project 2: Optimize Something

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing a stock portfolio to maximize the Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return. The objective is to determine the optimal stock allocations for a given set of stocks while adhering to specified constraints and leveraging optimization techniques. 

The project emphasizes **code implementation** of key portfolio performance metrics, including:
- **Cumulative Return**
- **Average Daily Return**
- **Sharpe Ratio**

Additionally, it uses the SciPy optimization library to determine stock allocations that maximize a specific portfolio metric. This implementation ensures accurate assessment and visualization of portfolio performance.

## Files
- **`optimization.py`**: Python script implementing data normalization, portfolio performance metrics, and the optimization function.
- **`optimization_report.pdf`**: Contains the comparison chart of the optimized portfolio against SPY. The chart serves as the critical rubric for evaluating the correctness of the code implementation.
