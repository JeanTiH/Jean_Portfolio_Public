# Machine Learning for Trading (ML4T)

**Overview:**
This directory contains 7 projects completed as part of the Machine Learning for Trading course. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of quantitative trading, including ***optimization***, ***portfolio management***, ***technical indicators***, and ***reinforcement learning***.

## Projects:

1. **Project 1: Martingale Strategy Simulation**
   - **Description**: Explores the Martingale betting strategy using an American Roulette wheel. Evaluates its performance under different bankroll conditions, providing insights into probabilistic concepts and risk management.

2. **Project 2: Optimize Something**
   - **Description**: Optimizes a stock portfolio to maximize the Sharpe Ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return. Implements portfolio performance metrics such as Cumulative Return, Average Daily Return, and Sharpe Ratio, using numerical optimization techniques to determine optimal stock allocations.

3. **Project 3: Assess Learners**
   - **Description**: Evaluates the performance of supervised learning algorithms for regression tasks. Compares Decision Tree Learner (DTLearner), Random Tree Learner (RTLearner), and Bagged Learner, focusing on overfitting, bagging, and trade-offs between training time and accuracy.

4. **Project 5: Market Simulator**
   - **Description**: Implements a Market Simulator to simulate trading activities and calculate portfolio values based on trades and market conditions. Evaluates trading strategies by modeling transaction costs, market impacts, and leverage limits.

5. **Project 6: Indicator Evaluation**
   - **Description**: Implements and evaluates a Theoretically Optimal Strategy (TOS) and five technical indicators (Price/SMA Ratio, Price Rate of Change, Golden/Death Cross, Bollinger Bands, and Percentage Price Oscillator). Compares their effectiveness in predicting stock price movements and outperforming benchmark strategies.

6. **Project 7: Q-Learning Robot**
   - **Description**: Implements a Q-Learning Agent for reinforcement learning tasks. Trains the agent to maximize rewards through trial-and-error learning, evaluating its ability to adapt and perform in simulated trading environments.

7. **Project 8: Strategy Evaluations**
   - **Description**: Implements and evaluates two trading strategies:
     - **Manual Strategy (MS)**: Combines technical indicators to generate buy/sell signals.
     - **Learner Strategy (LS)**: Uses a Random Forest classifier trained on technical indicators to make trading decisions.
     Compares these strategies to a benchmark across in-sample and out-of-sample periods, analyzing the impact of transaction costs and market conditions.
