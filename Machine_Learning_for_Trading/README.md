# Machine Learning for Trading (ML4T)

**Overview:**
This directory contains 8 projects completed as part of the Machine Learning for Trading course. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of quantitative trading, including ***optimization***, ***portfolio management***, ***technical indicators***, and ***reinforcement learning***.

## Projects:

1. **Project 1: Martingale Strategy Simulation**
   - **Description**: Simulates the Martingale betting strategy on an American Roulette wheel. Explores probabilistic concepts and the risks of doubling down after losses, drawing analogies to financial risk management.


2. **Project 2: Optimize Something**
   - **Description**: Focuses on optimization techniques to improve trading strategies. Implements portfolio optimization and resource allocation using numerical methods.

3. **Project 3: Assess Learners**
   - **Description**: Evaluates supervised learning algorithms to predict market behavior. Implements and compares models based on accuracy, robustness, and real-world applicability.

4. **Project 4: Defeat Learners**
   - **Description**: Develops advanced machine learning models designed to outperform baseline learners. Incorporates innovative data preprocessing and ensemble methods.

5. **Project 5: Marketsim**
   - **Description**: Builds a trading simulator to backtest portfolio strategies. Analyzes strategy performance using Sharpe ratio, volatility, and drawdown metrics.

6. **Project 6: Indicator Evaluation**
   - **Description**: Tests and evaluates technical indicators such as moving averages and Bollinger Bands. Assesses their effectiveness in generating profitable trading signals.

7. **Project 7: Q-Learning Robot**
   - **Description**: Implements a reinforcement learning agent to make trading decisions in simulated markets. Uses Q-learning to optimize strategies based on rewards and penalties.

8. **Project 8: Strategy Evaluation**
   - **Description**: Analyzes and compares multiple trading strategies based on returns and risks. Uses statistical methods to evaluate performance over time.
