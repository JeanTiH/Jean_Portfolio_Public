# Project 7: Q-Learner

## Overview
This project involves implementing a **Q-Learning Agent** to solve reinforcement learning problems. The Q-Learner is trained to maximize rewards through trial-and-error learning, where it iteratively updates a Q-table based on actions and observed rewards. The project focuses on applying the Q-Learner to a simulated environment, evaluating its ability to learn and adapt over time.

### Key Objectives
1. Implement a Q-Learner for reinforcement learning tasks.
2. Train the Q-Learner to maximize rewards by exploring and exploiting actions.
3. Apply the Q-Learner to a specific environment or problem and analyze its performance.
4. Evaluate the convergence of the Q-Learner and its learned policy.
