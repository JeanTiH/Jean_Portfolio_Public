# Project 3: Assess Learners

## Overview
This project evaluates the performance of different machine learning algorithms for regression tasks. Specifically, it compares a **Decision Tree Learner (DTLearner)**, a **Random Tree Learner (RTLearner)**, and a **Bagged Learner**. The project explores key concepts like overfitting, bagging for variance reduction, and trade-offs between training time and accuracy.

### Key Objectives
1. Examine the occurrence of overfitting with respect to leaf size.
2. Investigate how bagging can reduce or eliminate overfitting.
3. Compare the performance of DTLearner and RTLearner in terms of accuracy and training time.

## Files
- **`assesslearners.py`**: Python script implementing the regression learners (DTLearner, RTLearner, and Bagged Learner) and conducting experiments on training and testing datasets.
- **`assesslearners_report.pdf`**: Detailed report analyzing the learners' performance, including results, charts, and discussions on overfitting, bagging, and runtime efficiency.
