# Project 5: Market Simulator

## Overview
This project involves implementing a **Market Simulator** that simulates trading activities and calculates portfolio value over time based on trades and market conditions. The simulator allows for the evaluation of trading strategies by modeling transaction costs, market impacts, and leverage limits.

### Key Objectives
1. Implement a market simulator to calculate portfolio value based on a series of trades.
2. Incorporate the effects of transaction costs (commissions) and market impact on trades.
3. Support different trading constraints, such as leverage limits.
4. Enable evaluation of trading strategies by producing metrics like Sharpe Ratio, cumulative return, and volatility.
