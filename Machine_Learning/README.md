# Machine Learning (ML)

**Overview:**
This directory contains 4 projects completed as part of the Machine Learning coursework. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of machine learning, including ***supervised learning***, ***optimization***, ***unsupervised learning***, and ***reinforcement learning***.

## Projects:

1. **Project 1: Supervised Learning**
   - **Description**: Explores the performance of five supervised learning algorithms on binary classification problems. Analyzes how these algorithms behave under varying data characteristics, including balance, noise, and complexity, with a focus on algorithm tuning, dataset exploration, and comparative analysis.

2. **Project 2: Randomized Optimization**
   - **Description**: Evaluates the performance of four randomized optimization algorithms applied to three optimization problems and a neural network. Highlights their strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs in solving problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem, Knapsack Problem, and Flipflop Problem.

3. **Project 3: Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction**
   - **Description**: Analyzes clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms to understand their performance and impact on data. Examines how these techniques affect clustering quality and supervised learning when applied to dimensionality-reduced and cluster-enhanced datasets.

4. **Project 4: Reinforcement Learning**
   - **Description**: Implements reinforcement learning algorithms to solve Markov Decision Processes in two environments: Blackjack and Frozen Lake. Compares the performance of policy iteration, value iteration, and Q-learning, highlighting their strengths in deterministic and stochastic scenarios.
