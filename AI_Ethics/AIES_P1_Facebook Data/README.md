## Key Findings

1. **Advertiser Categories**:
   - Data was grouped into six main categories: **Shopping**, **Media & Publication**, **Finance & Education**, **Influencers**, **Entertainment**, and **Others**.
   - **Shopping** and **Influencers** had the most advertisers but also the highest irrelevant content.
   - **Entertainment** had the most accurate advertising with zero irrelevant content.

2. **Data Accuracy**:
   - Accuracy ranged from **35.7%** to **82.11%** across categories.
   - **Entertainment** demonstrated the highest accuracy, while **Influencers** had the most irrelevant content.

3. **Regulated Domains**:
   - Domains such as **Credit**, **Education**, **Employment**, and **Housing** were identified.
   - Advertisers included **TBC Bank**, **Zenith Prep Academy**, **LinkedIn**, and **Zillow**.

4. **Reflection on Privacy**:
   - Facebook's data collection raised privacy concerns, especially in predicting private traits from minimal interactions (e.g., gifting baseball gear).
   - Highlighted the need for caution in social media interactions to minimize unnecessary exposure of personal information.
