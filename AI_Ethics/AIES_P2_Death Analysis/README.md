# Project 2: Deaths in Custody Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates patterns and potential biases in deaths that occur in custody or during the process of arrest in California. By analyzing a dataset of deaths in custody, the study explores relationships between legally protected class variables (Age, Gender, Race) and outcomes like Manner of Death and Custody Status. The project evaluates whether observed patterns suggest fairness or bias and examines the implications of data manipulations like random sampling.

## Learning Outcomes
- Analyzed relationships between protected class variables and outcomes using statistical measures and visualizations.
- Investigated fairness and bias hypotheses with manipulated data presentations.
- Assessed the impact of random sampling on dataset distributions and protected class representation.
