# Project 4: Word Embeddings and Facial Recognition Analysis

## Overview
This project applies AI and machine learning algorithms to two domains: word embeddings and facial recognition. By using pre-trained Word2Vec models and the UTKFace dataset, the study evaluates semantic relationships, bias in protected classes, and the demographic representation in facial recognition data.

## Learning Outcomes
- Analyzed semantic relationships between words using Word2Vec embeddings, focusing on similarity, analogy, and correlation tasks.
- Identified bias in facial recognition datasets by examining the distribution of demographic attributes such as age, gender, and race.
- Explored the implications of underrepresentation in protected classes for algorithmic fairness and decision-making.
