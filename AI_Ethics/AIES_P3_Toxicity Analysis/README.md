# Project 3: Toxicity Analysis in Protected Classes

## Overview
This project analyzes relationships between protected class variables and toxicity levels in comments from Wikipedia Talk Pages. By examining correlations between attributes like Gender Identity, Race, and Religion with toxicity, the study evaluates potential biases in toxicity labeling and explores methods to measure and mitigate bias in AI systems.

## Learning Outcomes
- Identified correlations between protected classes and toxicity levels using statistical measures.
- Explored bias in natural language data and its implications for AI fairness and ethics.
- Assessed how sampling methods affect representation and measurement in data subsets.

## Files
- `toxity_per_attribute.csv`: Dataset of Wikipedia Talk Page comments and associated attributes.
- `P3_report.pdf`:Analysis report with results, visualizations, and insights.
