# Final Project: Bias Mitigation in Credit Decisions

## Overview
This project explores bias mitigation techniques in credit decision-making using the Credit Card Approvals dataset. The analysis evaluates fairness metrics such as Disparate Impact (DI) and Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) before and after applying bias mitigation techniques like reweighting. A Random Forest classifier is trained on both original and transformed datasets to assess the effectiveness of bias mitigation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Investigated bias in credit decision outcomes across protected classes (e.g., Age, Familial Status).
- Computed fairness metrics to evaluate and compare bias in privileged and unprivileged groups.
- Applied bias mitigation techniques and evaluated their effectiveness through fairness metrics and classification outcomes.
