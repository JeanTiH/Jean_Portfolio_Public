# Project 5: Fairness and Bias in Credit Decisions

## Overview
This project evaluates fairness and bias in credit decision-making using the Taiwan Credit Dataset. By analyzing legally protected class variables such as Age, Gender, and Marital Status, the study assesses bias using fairness metrics like Disparate Impact (DI) and Statistical Parity Difference (SPD). The project further explores bias mitigation strategies by adjusting decision thresholds for privileged and unprivileged groups.

## Learning Outcomes
- Investigated bias in credit decisions through fairness metrics.
- Assessed how different thresholds impact fairness and profitability in credit approval.
- Explored the trade-offs between fairness and financial outcomes in bias mitigation.
