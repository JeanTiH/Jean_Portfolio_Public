# Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society (AIES)

**Overview:**
This directory contains 6 projects completed as part of the AIES course. Each project focuses on critical aspects of AI, ethics, fairness, bias, and societal impacts, exploring issues such as data privacy, bias in decision-making, and algorithmic fairness.

## Projects:

1. **Project 1: Facebook Data Analysis**
   - **Description**: Examines how Facebook collects and uses user data for targeted advertising. Analyzes three years of advertising data to categorize advertisers, evaluate data accuracy, and explore intersections with regulated domains. Reflects on privacy concerns and strategies to manage social media interactions.

2. **Project 2: Deaths in Custody Analysis**
   - **Description**: Investigates patterns and potential biases in deaths occurring in custody or during arrests in California. Analyzes relationships between protected class variables (Age, Gender, Race) and outcomes such as Manner of Death and Custody Status. Evaluates fairness and bias with random sampling manipulations.

3. **Project 3: Toxicity Analysis in Protected Classes**
   - **Description**: Analyzes relationships between protected class variables and toxicity levels in Wikipedia Talk Page comments. Evaluates potential biases in toxicity labeling and explores methods for measuring and mitigating bias in natural language processing systems.

4. **Project 4: Word Embeddings and Facial Recognition Analysis**
   - **Description**: Applies AI algorithms to word embeddings and facial recognition. Evaluates semantic relationships, bias in protected classes, and demographic representation using Word2Vec embeddings and the UTKFace dataset. Explores the implications of underrepresentation in protected classes for algorithmic fairness.

5. **Project 5: Fairness and Bias in Credit Decisions**
   - **Description**: Evaluates fairness and bias in credit decision-making using the Taiwan Credit Dataset. Analyzes bias using metrics like Disparate Impact (DI) and Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) and explores bias mitigation through decision threshold adjustments.

6. **Final Project: Bias Mitigation in Credit Decisions**
   - **Description**: Explores bias mitigation techniques in credit decision-making using the Credit Card Approvals dataset. Evaluates fairness metrics such as DI and SPD before and after bias mitigation. Trains a Random Forest classifier on original and transformed datasets to assess the effectiveness of bias mitigation.
